If you want to improve your surfing performance, choosing the right **exercises for surfing** is critical. Generic gym routines won't cut it—you need **surf specific exercises** that target the exact movement patterns and energy systems used in the water.

This guide covers the **best exercises for surfers**, including movements that build paddle endurance, explosive pop-ups, rotational power, and dynamic balance. These **surfing exercises** are proven to translate directly to better wave-riding performance.

## **What Makes the Best Exercises for Surfers?**

The **best exercises for surfers** aren't about building beach muscles—they're about developing functional strength and endurance that directly improves surfing performance.

Effective **surfing exercises** should:

- **Target paddle-specific pulling patterns** (lats, shoulders, upper back)
- **Build explosive lower-body power** (for pop-ups and turns)
- **Develop rotational strength and stability** (for maneuvers)
- **Improve dynamic balance** (for stability on the board)
- **Enhance joint mobility** (especially shoulders and hips)

The following **surf specific exercises** check all these boxes.

</p>

The single-arm row is arguably the most important of all **exercises for surfing**. Why? Because paddling—which accounts for 50-60% of a surf session—is essentially repeated rowing motions.

_Source: [Farley, O. R., Harris, N. K., & Kilding, A. E. (2012). Physiological demands of competitive surfing. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, 26(7), 1887-1896](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/abstract/2012/07000/physiological_demands_of_competitive_surfing.20.aspx)_

This **surf specific exercise** trains the exact pulling pattern you use when paddling, making it one of the **best exercises for surfers** who want to build paddle power and endurance.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Builds unilateral paddle strength
- Develops lat and upper-back power for stronger strokes
- Improves scapular stability for shoulder health
- Trains anti-rotation through the core (mimicking asymmetrical paddling)

**How to perform:**

1. Hinge at the hips with one hand supported on a bench
2. Pull the dumbbell toward your hip, driving your elbow back
3. Control the lowering phase (don't drop the weight)
4. Keep your core braced and avoid rotating your torso

**Recommended volume:** 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side

## **2. Goblet Squat: Essential Lower-Body Exercise for Surfers**

</p>

Lower body strength is often overlooked by surfers, but strong legs are critical for explosive pop-ups and powerful turns. The goblet squat is one of the **best exercises for surfers** because it builds leg strength while improving hip mobility and squat mechanics.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Builds leg strength for fast, explosive pop-ups
- Improves hip and ankle mobility for deeper compression
- Develops core stability for maintaining posture
- Transfers directly to bottom turns and generating speed

**How to perform:**

1. Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell at chest height
2. Squat down keeping your chest upright and elbows inside your knees
3. Drive through your heels to stand explosively
4. Keep knees tracking over toes throughout the movement

**Recommended volume:** 3 sets of 8-10 reps

</p>

Traditional overhead pressing can aggravate surfer shoulders due to the high volume of overhead paddling. The half-kneeling press is one of the smartest **surfing exercises** because it builds shoulder strength safely while developing anti-extension core stability.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Builds overhead pressing strength without shoulder strain
- Develops anti-extension core control
- Improves hip flexor mobility (important for pop-ups)
- Teaches vertical force production from an unstable position

**How to perform:**

1. Kneel on one knee with the back knee down
2. Press a dumbbell overhead on the same side as the down knee
3. Keep your ribs down and core engaged—don't arch your back
4. Lower with control and repeat

**Recommended volume:** 3 sets of 8 reps per side

</p>

Loaded carries are among the most underrated **exercises for surfing**. The farmer carry builds crushing grip strength, shoulder stability, and core endurance—all essential qualities for sustained paddling performance.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Builds grip strength that directly transfers to paddle endurance
- Develops shoulder stabilizer muscles that protect against injury
- Strengthens core stability during dynamic movement
- Teaches proper posture under load (mimicking long paddle sessions)

**How to perform:**

1. Pick up heavy dumbbells or kettlebells in each hand
2. Stand tall with shoulders back and chest up
3. Walk with controlled, even steps
4. Don't let the weights swing or lean to either side

**Recommended volume:** 3 sets of 40-60 meter walks

</p>

Core training for surfers isn't about six-pack abs—it's about stability and anti-rotation control. The dead bug is one of the **best exercises for surfers** because it teaches your core to resist extension while your limbs move independently, exactly what happens during paddling and pop-ups.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Develops anti-extension core strength (protects your lower back)
- Improves coordination between upper and lower body movements
- Builds muscular endurance in the deep core stabilizers
- Transfers to maintaining board control during rotational maneuvers

**How to perform:**

1. Lie on your back with arms extended toward the ceiling
2. Lift legs to 90 degrees at hips and knees
3. Lower opposite arm and leg simultaneously while keeping your lower back pressed to the floor
4. Return to start position and repeat on the other side

**Recommended volume:** 3 sets of 10-12 reps per side

## **How to Program These Surfing Exercises**

The **best exercises for surfers** won't help if you program them incorrectly. Follow these principles when incorporating these **surf specific exercises** into your training:

- **Quality over quantity**: Perfect form on every rep matters more than lifting heavy
- **Moderate loads**: Choose weights that challenge you while allowing full control
- **Training frequency**: 2-4 sessions per week is optimal for most surfers
- **Prioritize recovery**: Your land training should support your surfing, not interfere with it
- **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase reps, sets, or weight every 2-3 weeks

# The 5 Best Strength Exercises for Surfers

If you're a surfer looking to improve your performance in the water, strength training is essential. But not just any strength training — you need exercises that actually translate to surfing. Here are the five best exercises that will make you a stronger, more powerful surfer.

## 1. Single-Arm Dumbbell Row

The single-arm row is arguably the most surf-specific exercise you can do. Why? Because
paddling is essentially repeated rowing motions.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Builds paddle endurance
- Develops lat strength for powerful strokes
- Improves scapular stability
- Teaches anti-rotation through the core

**How to perform:**

1. Hinge at the hips with one hand on a bench
2. Pull the dumbbell toward your hip
3. Control the lowering phase
4. Keep your core braced throughout

Start with 3 sets of 10 reps per side.

## 2. Goblet Squat

Lower body strength is often overlooked by surfers, but strong legs mean better pop-ups and more power through turns.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Builds leg strength for explosive pop-ups
- Improves hip mobility
- Develops core stability
- Transfers to compression and extension movements

**How to perform:**

1. Hold a dumbbell at chest height
2. Squat down keeping your chest up
3. Drive through your heels to stand
4. Keep knees tracking over toes

Aim for 3 sets of 8-10 reps.

## 3. Half-Kneeling Press

Traditional overhead pressing can be rough on surfer shoulders. The half-kneeling press is a shoulder-friendly alternative that builds pressing strength while improving core stability.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Builds shoulder strength safely
- Develops core anti-extension
- Improves hip flexor mobility
- Teaches vertical pushing from an unstable position

**How to perform:**

1. Kneel on one knee (back knee down)
2. Press a dumbbell overhead on the same side as the down knee
3. Keep your ribs down and core tight
4. Lower with control

Do 3 sets of 8 reps per side.

## 4. Farmer Carry

Carries are the unsung heroes of functional training. They build grip strength, shoulder stability, and core endurance — all crucial for surfing.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Improves paddle endurance through grip strength
- Builds shoulder stabilizer strength
- Develops core stability during movement
- Teaches proper posture under load

**How to perform:**

1. Pick up heavy dumbbells in each hand
2. Stand tall with shoulders back
3. Walk with controlled steps
4. Don't let the weights swing

Perform 3 sets of 40-meter walks.

## 5. Dead Bug

Core training for surfers shouldn't be about six-pack abs — it should be about stability and control. The dead bug teaches your core to resist extension while your limbs move independently.

**Benefits for surfing:**

- Develops anti-extension strength
- Improves coordination between upper and lower body
- Builds core endurance
- Protects the lower back during rotational movements

**How to perform:**

1. Lie on your back with arms reaching to ceiling
2. Lift legs to 90 degrees at hips and knees
3. Lower opposite arm and leg while keeping lower back pressed to floor
4. Return and repeat on other side

Do 3 sets of 10 reps per side.

## Programming Tips

Don't try to max out on these exercises. Surf-specific training should focus on:

- **Quality over quantity**: Perfect form on every rep
- **Moderate loads**: Heavy enough to challenge, light enough to control
- **Consistency**: 2-4 sessions per week is plenty
- **Recovery**: Leave enough energy for actual surfing

## The Bottom Line

These five exercises form the foundation of effective strength training for surfers. They target the movement patterns you use in the water without adding unnecessary bulk or grinding down your joints.

Remember: the gym should support your surfing, not compete with it. Train smart, surf better.

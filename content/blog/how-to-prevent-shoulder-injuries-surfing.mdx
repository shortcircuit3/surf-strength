# How to Prevent Shoulder Injuries While Surfing

Shoulder injuries are the most common ailment among surfers. All that paddling puts enormous demand on your shoulders — and if you're not prepared, something's going to give.

The good news? Most shoulder injuries are preventable with the right approach to training and mobility.

## Why Surfers Get Shoulder Problems

Surfing is heavily anterior-dominant. You're constantly reaching forward, paddling, and pushing up. Over time, this creates:

- **Tight chest muscles** pulling your shoulders forward
- **Weak upper back muscles** unable to balance the load
- **Poor scapular control** leading to impingement
- **Internal rotation dominance** limiting healthy movement

Add to this the high volume of paddling (hundreds of strokes per session), and you've got a recipe for injury.

## The 4 Pillars of Shoulder Health

### 1. Balance Your Pulling and Pushing

Most surfers need way more pulling than pushing. Your training should reflect this:

- **Aim for 2:1 or 3:1 pulling to pushing ratio**
- Emphasize horizontal pulls (rows) over vertical pulls (pulldowns)
- Choose shoulder-friendly pressing variations (floor press, landmine press, half-kneeling press)

### 2. Build Scapular Control

Your shoulder blade (scapula) is the foundation of shoulder health. Without proper scapular movement, the shoulder joint takes unnecessary stress.

**Key exercises:**
- Wall slides
- Band pull-aparts
- Prone Y-T-W raises
- Serratus push-ups

### 3. Maintain Thoracic Mobility

A stiff upper back forces your shoulders to compensate. Keep your thoracic spine mobile with:

- Thoracic rotations
- Cat-cow stretches
- Foam roller extensions
- Open book stretches

### 4. Strengthen the Rotator Cuff

The small muscles of the rotator cuff are your shoulder's stabilizers. They need direct attention:

- External rotations with band
- Side-lying external rotations
- Face pulls
- Prone horizontal abduction

## A Simple Shoulder Health Routine

Do this routine 2-3x per week, ideally before training or surfing:

**1. Thoracic Rotations** — 10 per side
Lie on your side, knees bent. Rotate your top arm across and back, following with your eyes.

**2. Wall Slides** — 10 reps
Stand with back against wall, arms in "goalpost" position. Slide arms up and down while maintaining contact.

**3. Band Pull-Aparts** — 15 reps
Hold a resistance band at arm's length. Pull apart to chest level, squeezing shoulder blades together.

**4. External Rotations** — 12 per side
Use a light band or weight. Rotate externally while keeping elbow pinned to side.

**5. Prone Y Raise** — 10 reps
Lie face down on bench or floor. Lift arms in Y shape with thumbs up, focusing on lower trapezius.

Total time: 8-10 minutes.

## Training Modifications for Surf Athletes

If you're training in the gym, make these swaps to protect your shoulders:

| Instead of... | Try... |
|--------------|--------|
| Bench press | Floor press or push-ups |
| Military press | Half-kneeling press |
| Lat pulldown | Face-pull + row combo |
| Upright row | High pull or face pull |
| Dips | Close-grip push-ups |

## Red Flags to Watch For

Stop and assess if you experience:

- **Sharp pain** during paddling or pressing
- **Night pain** that wakes you up
- **Catching or clicking** with certain movements
- **Weakness** in specific positions
- **Numbness or tingling** down the arm

These signs warrant professional evaluation.

## The Long Game

Shoulder health is a marathon, not a sprint. The best approach is:

1. **Consistent mobility work** — A little every day beats a lot occasionally
2. **Smart training ratios** — More pulling, less pushing
3. **Progressive strengthening** — Build capacity gradually
4. **Adequate recovery** — Don't surf and train hard on the same day

## Conclusion

Your shoulders are your surfing engine. Treat them well, and they'll give you years of pain-free paddling. The exercises and strategies above aren't complicated, but they require consistency.

Build shoulder health into your routine now, before you have a problem. Your future surfing self will thank you.
